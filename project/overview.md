# Project Overview

## Project Name
**ContentHive** — A Team Resource Hub & Public Content Library

## Vision
A smart content library where small teams and the public can collect, organize, and discover videos, posts, links, and text — surfaced through personalized interest-based feeds, not just passive storage.

The long-term vision is to evolve from a **filing cabinet → library → living knowledge brain**, where AI connects content, surfaces insights, and helps users think — not just store.

## Problem Statement
Teams and individuals consume a massive amount of content daily but have no shared, organized, searchable place to save and resurface it. Existing tools are either too personal (bookmarks), too heavy (Notion), or too social (Pinterest). ContentHive sits in the middle: lightweight, team-aware, and intelligent over time.

## Core User Types

| User | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Team Member** | Authenticated user, part of a team — can add, save, and view team-only + public content |
| **Public Visitor** | Unauthenticated or general user — can browse and view public content only |
| **Admin/Curator** | Team lead who manages categories, members, and content moderation |

---

## Content Types Supported
- 🎥 Video (YouTube embed, direct link)
- 📝 Text Post (written content, notes)
- 🔗 Link (external URL with preview)
- 🖼️ Image Post (optional, V2)

---

## Key Differentiators
1. **Interest-based feed** — users select topics on onboarding, feed reflects their profile
2. **Dual visibility** — content is either `team-only` or `public`, set at creation time
3. **Bookmark + identity** — saving content builds a user's public/private profile face
4. **Designed to scale** — V1 is lean, architecture supports V2/V3 intelligence features

---

## Versioning Strategy

### V1 — The Filing Cabinet *(Target: 3–4 weeks)*
Core loop: Collect → Organize → Search → View

### V2 — The Library *(1–2 months post V1)*
Notifications, mobile polish, related content, contributor profiles

### V3 — The Living Brain *(Future)*
AI summaries, knowledge graph, "ask the library" chat, team clustering

---

## Target Scale
- Small team initially (< 50 users)
- Public-facing content available to anyone
- Scale to larger audience in V2/V3
- Budget constraint: **≤ $50/month operational cost**
